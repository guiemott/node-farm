# 🌽 Node Farm

## First Node.JS project to learn fundamentals

This project was created as a project from a [Node.JS](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/) course.</br>

### 👨🏽‍💻 In this course I learned some Node.JS fundamentals, such as:

- Creating a HTTP local server
- Using URL, FS, HTTP, Slugify, and Nodemon packages
- DOM manipulation using HTTP and URL packages
- Understanding a filepath structure
- Exporting and importing custom modules
